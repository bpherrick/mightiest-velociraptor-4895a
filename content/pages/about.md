**Hello there!**

We are Ben, Paige and Josephine Grace (JoJo) Herrick. Welcome to our blog! BenandPaigeHerrick.com is where we will keep you updated on what is going on in our ministry. Grab a cup of coffee or tea, get in a comfy chair and let's visit a while.

For those of you unfamiliar with us, we hail from Missouri. Ben and I have been married just over 2 years and our little JoJo will soon be celebrating her first birthday!

So, how did we come to be entering the missions field? Well, missions is something Ben and I have discussed since we were dating. We both have hearts and careers bent towards service. Ben has experience both domestically and internationally in youth development as well as sports and project management. His experience includes co-founding day camps for children with incarcerated parents, building youth sports programs in Peru and leading groups of kids on service projects in Cuba. I am a registered nurse with 12 years experience. Most of my career has largely been in cardiology (heart related) fields and one incredible year as a school nurse. I have also volunteered and served with local churches during VBS and gone on missions trips domestically. Our little JoJo will serve along side us as our beautiful little barrier breaker.

We are excited to be partnering with the International Sports Federation (ISF) and the local churches to aide the impoverished in Cape Town, South Africa and the forcibly displaced refugees in Athens, Greece.

We leave for Cape Town, South Africa in April 2022. We will spend 2 months serving there. We wiwill then head onto Athens, Greece for 1 month. We have been invited to serve in other European contexts if funds allow.

We highly encourage you to check out our donation website, HerricksOnMission.com. This is where you will be able to give a monetary gift that will allow us to go and serve on the ground in these communities. All donations are 100% tax deductible.
