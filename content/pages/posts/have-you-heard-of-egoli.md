## Have you heard of Egoli? 

I honestly hadn't until we partnered with the International Sports Federation (ISF). I decided to do a quick google search and typed in "Egoli, South Africa". I kid you not, the first thing that popped up was a Soap Opera called, "Egoli: Place of Gold". Honestly, not at all what I expected to pop up. Egoli is also an alternative name for Johannesburg. Interesting, but still not what I was expecting to find. What I was looking for is located on the outskirts of Cape Town, South Africa at the foot of Table Mountain. This is where you will find a squatter camp where twenty-five thousand people are crammed in the equivalent of 2 city blocks living in abject poverty. Sixty percent of the population in Egoli are under the age of 14 years old. Many of these children are orphaned and have no one to care for them.

Let's briefly look at what abject poverty means. Poverty is the state of being extremely poor. Abject is used to emphasize a situation or quality that is extremely bad. One word that I saw over and over on my search of the word abject was this, "hopeless". 

I don't want to leave you at hopeless. Cue in Pastor Brian Keet, his wife Glenda and the Tekiah Church. These incredible people are who we will be working with during our time in South Africa. Pastor Brian and his church saw great need and have set out to give these people hope. Thus the Mountain View Dream Centre was born. The Dream Centre is a dream in progress with many dreams having come to fruition and more dreams yet to be fulfilled. Ben, JoJo and I will be going to assist Pastor Brian and the Tekiah Church with their mission to combat poverty and give the children and people of Egoli a better tomorrow.
