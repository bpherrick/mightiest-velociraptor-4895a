##### Most of you know the saying...or some variation of it. "Whenever God closes a door, He opens a window". Well, that in a nutshell is how our God journey began. 

We had been renting a duplex since we got married. When our daughter was about 2 months old, we got notice from our landlords that they were putting our unit up for sale. Being first time parents who had just brought a brand new baby home, we were pretty shell shocked by this news. Our initial plan had never been to stay in the Mid-Missouri area long. However, by-in-large, both of our families live in Missouri. So, with a new baby and plans to continue growing our little family of three, we dove head first into the craziest housing market we have ever seen. We house hunted and house hunted....and house hunted. We put offers in on a few properties with nothing coming to fruition. Finally, we found a cute little fixer upper with good bones. We put in an offer and it was accepted! We were elated to be under contract for our first home! The inspection was passing with flying colors. I was planning interior and exterior home plans. Then the hammer fell. The sewer inspection was a GIGANTIC fail. Essentially, the entire sewer system was complete poop (pun intended). It was going to be in the ballpark of a twenty-thousand dollar fix. We thought surely the home owners would negotiate price. No dice. With our current home officially sold and needing to be moved out in a few weeks, we walked away from the house that we thought we were moving into. Thankfully all of our parents are amazing and helped us to navigate through our housing debacle. 

Doors Closed.

Simultaneously during our house hunt, Ben was on the job hunt. His job was contracted and we had no idea if the contract would be renewed for the following year. There were several good leads. One in particular stands out in my mind. We were under the impression that Ben was practically a shoe-in for the position. He went through several rounds of interviews. Only one minor issue, Ben wasn't sure that even if he was offered the position that he would want to take it. The earning potential for this job was....well, a lot. The cost to that earning potential was the amount of time he would have to sacrifice with his family. It came down to the final interview, Ben and one other applicant. Experience won out and the other applicant got the job. 

Doors Closed. 

In the midst of all that chaos, Ben had reconnected with an old friend who serves on the mission field with the International Sports Federation (ISF). This is usually where I ask Ben to take over telling our story. I'll try to make it concise. The long and short of it is that Ben and I started prayerfully discussing entering the mission field. I wish I could say that when God knocked I was ready and willing, but that wasn't the case. It's not that I was unwilling....I just wanted to pump the brakes on a train that was quickly gaining momentum. We had several meetings with Ben's friend and the director of ISF. We figured we would have a rigorous application period. We wondered if they would even allow us to partner with them? We couldn't have been more wrong. We were welcomed with open arms and asked where we wanted to go. We were baffled....and speechless. Only after reassurances that we would not be air-dropped into the middle of nowhere with our new baby did I finally let God's peace wash over me. 

Windows opened. 

We will be heading for Cape Town, South Africa on January 19, 2022. We will spend 3 months in South Africa working with those living in abject poverty. We will come home for 3 weeks and regroup. Then we will head to Athens, Greece for 3 months where we will work with forcibly displaced refugees.

We have met our first fundraising goal of raising $5,000.00 by 9/1/2021! Praise God for that! We encourage you to check out our sister site Herricksonmission.com to donate. All donations are 100% tax deductible. All of the funds raised go directly to our family so that we may go and be a blessing to the impoverished and the displaced. 

Our next fundraising goal is $15,000.00 by October 1st! Let's keep the momentum going!!!

From the bottom of our hearts we thank you for your generosity! 
Love and Blessings to each of you.
