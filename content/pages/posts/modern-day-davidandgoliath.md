Mandela wrote in his autobiography 'Long Walk to Freedom' that, "His people didn't lack ability, but lacked opportunities." Though apartheid ended in 1994, there continues to be a huge disparity between the rich and the poor people of South Africa. The issue of poverty is entangled with years of political corruption, unemployment, housing shortages, and a racist caste system separating people by creed and color. 

Want to hear a modern day David and Goliath story? (1 Samuel 17). Cue in Pastor Brian and Glenda Keet and the Tekiah Church. The Keets are taking the poverty battle head on. Pastor Brian and Glenda are native to the area and knew that the people living in Egoli were in need of help. Initially, Pastor Brian and the Tekiah Church went into the informal settlement to feed hungry people. Because of the immense need witnessed in Egoli, the Tekiah Foundation and the Mountain View Dream Centre (where we will be serving with Pastor Brian and Glenda) were created to give a safe place of refuge and hope for the future generations living in Egoli. (Jeremiah 29:11)

Imagine living in a home with no electricity, no heat, no running water, no floor. Imagine that the shack you live in gets destroyed about 3 times a year when the winds blow across the Cape or when kerosene starts a fire in the winter. Imagine not knowing when, where or how you and your children will get the next meal. Imagine orphans trying to survive these conditions on their own. These situations and more are everyday realities in Egoli and other informal settlements like it. Seems pretty hopeless, right?

Just like in David and Goliath, the Keets are overcoming what seems impossible. Because of generous donors and the grace and faithfulness of God, the Keets and the Tekiah Church are able to combat poverty and give hope to the hopeless. Hundreds are fed a warm breakfast and the word of God each and everyday. Programs have been created to engage the children and teach them sports, singing, and dance. Children that aren't in school that ought to be, are helped to get an education. A medical clinic has been set up with the aid of area healthcare workers on Thursdays. Pastor Glenda leads a women's bible study group on Monday nights. Ben and I are very excited for the most recent project the Keets are working on: construction of a workshop! This workshop will be used to teach basic trades and carpentry to people who currently lack skills, so that they have an opportunity for employment. 

There are many more goals and dreams for what the Mountainview Dream Centre will become. These dreams include: putting a roof on the church, building a multi-sport facility, and an orphanage. The Keets run an NGO...meaning they build when money comes in. To quote Pastor Brian, "They live by faith with big goals". They know how to be content when they have plenty and in times of lack. (Phillipians 4:11-13). They have been a tremendous blessing and example of living by faith to Ben and I. We are blessed to know the Keets! Ben and I are very excited and looking forward to working alongside the Keets and the Tekiah Church sharing the Gospel and providing opportunities to those with none.

We welcome you to partner with us and become an active participant in this unfolding story! Your financial partnership with Ben and I provides the opportunity for us to be effective missionaries on the ground. Some Christians believe that the role of sharing the Gospel belongs only to pastors and missionaries, but everyone has the responsibility to be involved. God will reveal what work He is calling you to do. No one is insignificant or without purpose. The limiting factor is never the Lord's ability to use us, but our availability to His call.
