God is so faithful and oh so good! He provides for our every need. (Philippians 4:19). Ben and I are excited to share that God has provided through your giving! Our March 15th financial deadline was met on March 13th! Currently, 75% of the funds required for our vision trip to South Africa and Greece have been raised. Praise be to God!

Our next financial deadline is set for April 15th. We look forward to how God moves in the coming months.

If funds allow, we have opportunities to serve refugees in France and Italy following our service in South Africa and Greece. We were just informed today of opportunities to serve Ukranian refugees in Ireland and Poland as well. We are praying by faith that God will open doors that no man can shut and allow us to serve His kingdom in each of these capacities. (2 Corinthians 9:8).

Please continue to keep us in your prayers! We are so incredibly thankful and blessed by each of your prayers and financial giving. May God bless and keep each of you.
