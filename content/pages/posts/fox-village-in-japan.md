Ya'll know the saying.... or some variation of it. I know you do. "Whenever God closes a door, he opens a window". Well, that in a nutshell is how our God journey began.

We had been renting a duplex since we got married. When our daughter was 2 months old, we got notice from our landlords that they would be selling our unit. As new parents who just brought a brand new baby home, we were pretty shell shocked by this. Our initial plan had never been to stay in the Mid-Missouri area long. However, by large, both of our families are in Missouri. So, with a new baby and plans to continue growing our family of three we dove head first into the craziest housing market we have ever seen. We house hunted and house hunted....and house hunted. We put offers in on a couple of places that never came to fruition. Then finally, we found a cute little fixer upper and put a contract on it. Our offer was accepted! We were finally under contract on our first home!!! We were elated. The house had good bones. The inspection was passing with flying colors. I was dreaming up all kinds of interior and exterior designs. Then the hammer fell....the sewer system was a GIGANTIC fail. Basically, the existing one was complete poop (pun intended) and it was going to cost in the ballpark of twenty thousand dollars to fix. We thought surely the homeowners would negotiate the price? No dice. What the heck were we going to do? The duplex we called home had sold. We only had a few weeks to move out.  And we had just walked away from the home we thought we were going to move into.

Fortunately, we have amazing parents. They all have helped us navigate through our housing debacle.

Door closed.

Simultaneously whilst all this house hunting is happening. Ben was job hunting. His job is contracted and we had no guarantees if it would continue into the following year. There were several promising opportunities. One, in particular stands out. We were under the impression that he was a shoe-in for the position. Although everything seemed really promising, Ben wasn't 100% sure that if he was offered the position that he wanted to take it, but the earning potential was....well, a lot. The cost to the earning potential was the amount of time it would take Ben away from home and our family time. The decision ended up being made for us. It came down to Ben and one other candidate...experience won out and the other candidate got the position.

Door closed.

We had been praying for clarity, God's will and for our obedience to His will. Everything was still so murky at this point, but one thing was becoming more and more clear. It was becoming evident that Mid-Missouri was not where we were going to be putting down roots. This is usually the point where I let Ben start telling the story of how he reconnected with an old friend who serves with The International Sports Federation (ISF). Long story short, Ben and I started discussing entering the mission field. Albeit, me with some reservation. I wish I could say that when God knocked, I was ready and willing. I wasn't unwilling, but I wanted to put the brakes on a train that was gaining momentum quickly. (That is another blog post though). We met with the director of ISF. We thought we would go through a giant screening process. Would they even accept us to partner with them? We were greeted with open arms and asked where we wanted to go. We were baffled...and speechless. After assurances that we would not be air dropped into the Congo with our new baby I finally let God's peace wash over me. Ben and I continued to pray and discuss what this opportunity meant and should we really go. Ultimately, I said that I believed if we pursued anything else we would be disobeying God.

Doors opened.

Now, we are excitedly preparing ourselves for serving the people of Egoli who are living in abject poverty just outside of Cape Town, South Africa and then with refugees that have fled to Athens, Greece.
